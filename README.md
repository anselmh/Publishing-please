# Publishing Please!

This project wants to improve two things:

- the tools which are on the market
- the users who use or want to use these tools :)

So please â€“ share this project and file bugs to get it better. If you want to write an article, please use the Wiki here and file a bug, so it can be added to website after review.  
And don't forget to attach a photo, your website or twittername to the text.

So, now look at: http://publishing-please.com/ and file bugs here to improve your live in some months or years!
